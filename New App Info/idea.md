What is Luni?


History of the Name

Luni has a double meaning. It comes from the Canadian 1 dollar coin the “Loonie”, however it is spelled Luni. This is the case as Uni is short for university, so it combines the money concept into a student minded approach.

Goal of Luni
The goal is for students to be more aware of their spending habits, and to help them figure out a realistic plan to achieve their goals. My goal is for students to have the best support they can, and to learn from their small mistakes early on before making larger ones which can end poorly. Everyone bleeds money, however it’s important to understand where the bleeding is coming from.

Background of how and why it was created
This is made by a university student who understands the stress money brings on someone who is learning about being on their own away from their parents. I had to pay half of my schooling, which gave me a better understanding of how to save money than most other students my age. Although I felt broke all the time, I understood when to spend, and save money to have the most fun I could have while being conscious and careful to not exceed my budget. I wanted to teach and provide software for other students like me who may struggle with managing funds or understanding where their money went. Some who are still greatly supported by their parents and don’t know the value of money, which is ok, but with reliance can come poor money management. This app is here to help solve the problem of lack of financial understanding as a student, and help better prepare for the future. This can range from getting out of debt, investing money sitting in the account to come out of university with assets, or even allowing you to go on a vacation. 

Overall Concept
I want to forecast their financial goals, and give them insights into how to spend/save their money. The goal of this program is to give the user an understanding of what their spending values are, understand what their current net worth/value is, what steps they need to take (where to allocate their resources) to achieve their goals. 


What I want to accomplish for the user
Understand their spending breakdown in real time
Know where their bleeding comes from, what to look out for
If splitting money in a household, or on random expenses, how to deal with that
Forecast users next month, semester, year, years… and create a plan to help them
Create goals and achievements
Make managing money more interesting
