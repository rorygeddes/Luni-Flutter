# Authentication & Profile Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ UserModel Missing `createdAt` Field
**Problem:** The profile view was trying to access `createdAt` but it didn't exist in `UserModel`.

**Solution:** 
- Added `createdAt` field to `UserModel`
- Updated `copyWith` method
- Regenerated JSON serialization code
- Fixed `user_id` → `id` mapping to match database schema

### 2. ✅ Email Confirmation Blocking Sign-in
**Problem:** After sign-up, users couldn't sign in because Supabase requires email confirmation by default.

**Solution:** 
- Created `SUPABASE_EMAIL_SETUP.md` with instructions
- User needs to disable email confirmation in Supabase Dashboard
- Alternative: manually confirm users via SQL or Dashboard

### 3. ✅ Profile View Using Mock Data
**Problem:** All profile data was hardcoded.

**Solution:**
- Converted `ProfileView` to `StatefulWidget`
- Loads real user data from `AuthService.getCurrentUserProfile()`
- Displays:
  - Real full name
  - Real username
  - Real email
  - Real avatar (or default icon)
  - Real member since date

## Current Authentication Flow

```
1. User signs up with email/password/username/fullName
   ↓
2. Supabase creates user in auth.users
   ↓
3. Database trigger creates profile in profiles table
   ↓
4. App waits 2 seconds for trigger to complete
   ↓
5. App verifies profile was created
   ↓
6. User session is saved
   ↓
7. User navigated to MainLayout
   ↓
8. Profile data loaded and displayed
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Disable email confirmation in Supabase (see `SUPABASE_EMAIL_SETUP.md`)
- [ ] Sign up with new user
- [ ] Verify user is signed in immediately
- [ ] Check profile view shows real data:
  - [ ] Full name displays correctly
  - [ ] Username displays with @ symbol
  - [ ] Email displays correctly
  - [ ] Member since date shows
- [ ] Verify no compilation errors

## Next Steps

1. **Disable Email Confirmation** (Critical!)
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
   - Turn OFF "Enable email confirmations"
   - Save changes

2. **Test Sign-up Flow**
   - Create a new account
   - Should sign in immediately
   - Profile should show all real data

3. **Verify Database**
   - Check that profiles table has data
   - Verify trigger is working
   - Confirm RLS policies allow reads

## Known Issues

⚠️ **User must disable email confirmation in Supabase** or sign-in will fail with "Invalid login credentials"

## Database Schema

The `profiles` table should have:
- `id` (UUID, primary key, references auth.users)
- `username` (TEXT, unique)
- `full_name` (TEXT)
- `email` (TEXT)
- `avatar_url` (TEXT)
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
