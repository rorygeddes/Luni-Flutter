# Fix All Current Errors - Quick Guide

## üîß Database Fixes (Run in Supabase SQL Editor)

Run these SQL scripts **in order**:

### 1. Fix Friends System (Duplicate Friends Issue)
```sql
-- File: docs/sql/ADD_FRIENDS_SYSTEM_SIMPLE.sql
-- This deduplicates friends when both users add each other
```
**Run this file in Supabase!**

### 2. Fix Split RLS Policies (Infinite Recursion Error)
```sql
-- File: docs/sql/FIX_SPLIT_RLS_POLICIES.sql
-- This fixes the circular reference in RLS policies
```
**Run this file in Supabase!**

### 3. Fix Group Members RLS Policy (if needed)
```sql
-- Add this to Supabase if you still get group_members errors:

-- Drop old policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view group members they belong to" ON group_members;

-- Create simpler policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view group members they belong to"
ON group_members FOR SELECT
USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Add policy for group owners to see members
CREATE POLICY "Group creators can see all members"
ON group_members FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM groups g 
    WHERE g.id = group_members.group_id 
    AND g.created_by = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

## üöÄ Quick Test

After running the SQL fixes:

1. **Hot restart your app**
2. Go to **Split screen**
3. Try **creating a group**
4. Try **splitting a transaction**

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Results

- ‚úÖ No infinite recursion errors
- ‚úÖ Friends show up only once (no duplicates)
- ‚úÖ Groups load correctly
- ‚úÖ Split transactions work
- ‚úÖ Group members display properly

---

## üìù Summary of What Was Fixed

1. **Friends System**
   - Added DISTINCT ON to eliminate duplicate friends
   - Fixed when both users add each other

2. **Split Transactions**
   - Removed circular RLS policy references
   - Simplified to prevent infinite recursion

3. **Group Creation**
   - New feature to create groups with friends
   - Beautiful UI with friend selection
   - Fully functional with haptic feedback

---

## üÜò If Errors Persist

Run this diagnostic query in Supabase:

```sql
-- Check if policies exist
SELECT tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename IN ('split_transactions', 'split_participants', 'group_members', 'friends')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

This will show all existing policies so we can debug further!
