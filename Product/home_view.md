This is a log of the updates I do to the home screen. Always follow the most latest updates at the bottom of the code so understand that first.

I want to add in seeing the star and fire icons we have in the profile view in the homs screne. 

I want to remove the loonscore and streak words and replace them with the icons. 

I want the icons to be above the amount. 

I want both of these to be seamlessly in a joint looking div, where you can press on both of them to get a full screen modal view of the points. that view will be made later. 

- Make them into visually seperate from each other into 2 divs

New Updates:

- I want the screen to be fully modal.
