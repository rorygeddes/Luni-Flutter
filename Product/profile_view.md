I want this view to take us to a settings view. I want you to use instagrams mvp for this view and have it the same of how it works with the settings part, and you hit back to go back to the main home screen. the back is in the top left. in this profile view, you have your profile image, name, birthday. THen you have your email that you have linked there too. You then have a settings that is in the top right of that screen too where you can change things about the modes. Make this super sleek and follow the format of the current app
