I want the screens to have a sleek navigation when changing screens. I don't want everything to reload, I want the main screen inside the header and footer to change.

I want the navigation to be seamless, right now it's going through a bunch of screens, I want one seamless navigation

Make the pane in the main screen between the header and footer to change, not flip between the whole screen reloading.
