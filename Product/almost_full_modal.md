I want the bottom to also be white, I want it to go down right to the bottom of the phone. I want the top bar thing you can see to be removed. I don't want it to be darker behind it, I want it to just be the same background you can see normally. I also want it to not go all the way to the top of the screen, I want the x button to be right below where the header is so you can see the header while in this modal view. I want it to only have 1 x button when it pops up, and I want it to stop at the header. I also want the top of it to be rounded to look like that modal pop up.
