I want the full screen modal to bring up a white screen that looks like this: I want the top to be still the background app, make it almost full screen modal. Keep the background the white is important. I also want the header and footer to always be in the app, right now when i hit the plus, it goes away. Except when we use the almost full screen modal, if you slide it down, thats how you get back.
