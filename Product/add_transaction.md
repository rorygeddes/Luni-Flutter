I want this to be like snap shats camera mode feature. When you click the camera a phone screen pops up like how it works on snapshat with a circle where you take the picture. 

I also want in the bottom left to be an option of your photos, where you can click in, see your photos, select it, and upload it to the ai to parse through the screen and get the transaction. 

Don't worry about the functionality for now, just make this siumple ui for the plus button. I also dont want to see the header, just the footer, and nothing else other than the image picker spot in the bottom left. It's icon is like a receipt and underneath it says images.

After you take a picture, it will have options saying Uplaod. It will automatically save in your saved if you swipe up.

If you swipe up from the image spot, this is where you can see all of your past uploads, even the images ones and it will get categorized by the cycle. It will say the current cycle, and then the dates for the first one you see, but then if you scroll down, you can see past cycles, and it will give you the dates after it says last cycle. Example: Current Cycle - September 1st - September 30th.

Updates & Error handling

- I want the camera to be allowed and it automatically shows the back camera.
- I want the button to be faint and still be shown when the camera is on, and it to be right above the plus, in the bottom part of the pane
- I want the footer navigation to still be able to work. 
- i dont want the bottom footer to change colour, always keep the theme colours we have so right now be white.
- I don't want the text tap to take a picture of your receipt just be the button.
